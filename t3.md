# Part 3: SLURM Partitions and Queues {#part-3-slurm-partitions-and-queues .unnumbered}

## 3.1 Understanding Partitions {#understanding-partitions .unnumbered}

In SLURM, a partition is a logical grouping of nodes and resources on
the cluster. Partitions allow you to allocate resources based on
different criteria, such as hardware specifications or user groups.

## 3.2 Listing Partitions {#listing-partitions .unnumbered}

List available partitions using the `sinfo` command.

``` {.bash language="bash"}
# Example listing partitions
sinfo -s
```

## 3.3 Job Submission to a Specific Partition {#job-submission-to-a-specific-partition .unnumbered}

Specify a partition when submitting a job using the `-p` flag.

``` {.bash language="bash"}
# Example job submission to a specific partition
sbatch -p partition_name my_job.sh
```

## 3.4 Understanding Queues {#understanding-queues .unnumbered}

Queues within partitions further categorize jobs. Jobs submitted to a
partition can be directed to specific queues based on their
requirements.

## 3.5 Listing Queues {#listing-queues .unnumbered}

List queues within a partition using the `sinfo` command.

``` {.bash language="bash"}
# Example listing queues
sinfo -p partition_name --Format="%Q"
```

## 3.6 Job Submission to a Specific Queue {#job-submission-to-a-specific-queue .unnumbered}

Specify a queue when submitting a job using the `â€“qos` flag.

``` {.bash language="bash"}
# Example job submission to a specific queue
sbatch --partition=partition_name --qos=queue_name my_job.sh
```

Congratulations! You've learned about SLURM partitions and queues. In
the next tutorial, we'll explore job dependencies and advanced
submission options.
