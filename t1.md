# Introduction {#introduction .unnumbered}

SLURM (Simple Linux Utility for Resource Management) is an open-source
job scheduler and resource manager widely used in high-performance
computing (HPC) environments. It allows users to submit, monitor, and
manage parallel and distributed jobs on a cluster.

This tutorial series aims to provide a comprehensive guide to using
SLURM, starting from the basics and progressing to advanced topics.

# Part 1: Introduction and Installation {#part-1-introduction-and-installation .unnumbered}

## 1.1 What is SLURM? {#what-is-slurm .unnumbered}

SLURM is a highly scalable and flexible workload manager designed for
Linux clusters. It provides a framework for job scheduling, resource
allocation, and job management.

## 1.2 Installation {#installation .unnumbered}

To get started with SLURM, you need to install it on your cluster.
Follow these steps:

### 1.2.1 Prerequisites {#prerequisites .unnumbered}

Make sure your system meets the following prerequisites:

-   Linux operating system

-   Root or sudo access

### 1.2.2 Download SLURM {#download-slurm .unnumbered}

Download the latest version of SLURM from the official website or use
your package manager.

``` {.bash language="bash"}
# Example using wget
wget https://download.schedmd.com/slurm/slurm-20.02.7.tar.bz2
```

### 1.2.3 Extract and Compile {#extract-and-compile .unnumbered}

Extract the downloaded tarball and compile SLURM.

``` {.bash language="bash"}
tar -xvf slurm-20.02.7.tar.bz2
cd slurm-20.02.7
./configure
make
sudo make install
```

### 1.2.4 Configure SLURM {#configure-slurm .unnumbered}

Configure SLURM by editing the slurm.conf file. Customize it based on
your cluster's architecture.

``` {.bash language="bash"}
# Example editing slurm.conf
sudo nano /usr/local/etc/slurm.conf
```

### 1.2.5 Start SLURM Services {#start-slurm-services .unnumbered}

Start the SLURM services on your cluster.

``` {.bash language="bash"}
# Example starting SLURM services
sudo systemctl start slurmctld
sudo systemctl start slurmd
```

### 1.2.6 Verify Installation {#verify-installation .unnumbered}

Verify that SLURM is running correctly.

``` {.bash language="bash"}
# Example checking SLURM status
sinfo
squeue
```

# Part 2: Basic Job Submission and Management {#part-2-basic-job-submission-and-management .unnumbered}

## 2.1 Job Submission {#job-submission .unnumbered}

Now that SLURM is installed, let's submit a basic job. Create a simple
job script, for example, `my_job.sh`, and submit it to the SLURM queue.

``` {.bash language="bash"}
# Example job script (my_job.sh)
#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH --job-name=my_job
#SBATCH --output=output.txt
#SBATCH --error=error.txt
#SBATCH --ntasks=1
#SBATCH --time=1:00:00

echo "Hello, SLURM!"
```

Submit the job using the `sbatch` command.

``` {.bash language="bash"}
# Example job submission
sbatch my_job.sh
```

## 2.2 Job Management {#job-management .unnumbered}

Check the status of your submitted job using `squeue`.

``` {.bash language="bash"}
# Example checking job status
squeue
```

View detailed information about a specific job.

``` {.bash language="bash"}
# Example checking detailed job information
scontrol show job <JOB_ID>
```

Cancel a job using `scancel`.

``` {.bash language="bash"}
# Example canceling a job
scancel <JOB_ID>
```
