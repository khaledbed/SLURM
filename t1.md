# Introduction 

SLURM (Simple Linux Utility for Resource Management) is an open-source
job scheduler and resource manager widely used in high-performance
computing (HPC) environments. It allows users to submit, monitor, and
manage parallel and distributed jobs on a cluster.

This tutorial series aims to provide a comprehensive guide to using
SLURM, starting from the basics and progressing to advanced topics.

# Part 1: Introduction and Installation 

## 1.1 What is SLURM?

SLURM is a highly scalable and flexible workload manager designed for
Linux clusters. It provides a framework for job scheduling, resource
allocation, and job management.

## 1.2 Installation 

To get started with SLURM, you need to install it on your cluster.
Follow these steps:

### 1.2.1 Prerequisites 

Make sure your system meets the following prerequisites:

-   Linux operating system

-   Root or sudo access

### 1.2.2 Download SLURM 

Download the latest version of SLURM from the official website or use
your package manager.

``` {.bash language="bash"}
# Example using wget
wget https://download.schedmd.com/slurm/slurm-20.02.7.tar.bz2
```

### 1.2.3 Extract and Compile 

Extract the downloaded tarball and compile SLURM.

``` {.bash language="bash"}
tar -xvf slurm-20.02.7.tar.bz2
cd slurm-20.02.7
./configure
make
sudo make install
```

### 1.2.4 Configure SLURM 

Configure SLURM by editing the slurm.conf file. Customize it based on
your cluster's architecture.

``` {.bash language="bash"}
# Example editing slurm.conf
sudo nano /usr/local/etc/slurm.conf
```

### 1.2.5 Start SLURM Services 

Start the SLURM services on your cluster.

``` {.bash language="bash"}
# Example starting SLURM services
sudo systemctl start slurmctld
sudo systemctl start slurmd
```

### 1.2.6 Verify Installation 

Verify that SLURM is running correctly.

``` {.bash language="bash"}
# Example checking SLURM status
sinfo
squeue
```

# Part 2: Basic Job Submission and Management 

## 2.1 Job Submission 

Now that SLURM is installed, let's submit a basic job. Create a simple
job script, for example, `my_job.sh`, and submit it to the SLURM queue.

``` {.bash language="bash"}
# Example job script (my_job.sh)
#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH --job-name=my_job
#SBATCH --output=output.txt
#SBATCH --error=error.txt
#SBATCH --ntasks=1
#SBATCH --time=1:00:00

echo "Hello, SLURM!"
```

Submit the job using the `sbatch` command.

``` {.bash language="bash"}
# Example job submission
sbatch my_job.sh
```

## 2.2 Job Management 

Check the status of your submitted job using `squeue`.

``` {.bash language="bash"}
# Example checking job status
squeue
```

View detailed information about a specific job.

``` {.bash language="bash"}
# Example checking detailed job information
scontrol show job <JOB_ID>
```

Cancel a job using `scancel`.

``` {.bash language="bash"}
# Example canceling a job
scancel <JOB_ID>
```
# Part 3: SLURM Partitions and Queues

## 3.1 Understanding Partitions 

In SLURM, a partition is a logical grouping of nodes and resources on
the cluster. Partitions allow you to allocate resources based on
different criteria, such as hardware specifications or user groups.

## 3.2 Listing Partitions 

List available partitions using the `sinfo` command.

``` {.bash language="bash"}
# Example listing partitions
sinfo -s
```

## 3.3 Job Submission to a Specific Partition 

Specify a partition when submitting a job using the `-p` flag.

``` {.bash language="bash"}
# Example job submission to a specific partition
sbatch -p partition_name my_job.sh
```

## 3.4 Understanding Queues {#understanding-queues .unnumbered}

Queues within partitions further categorize jobs. Jobs submitted to a
partition can be directed to specific queues based on their
requirements.

## 3.5 Listing Queues {#listing-queues .unnumbered}

List queues within a partition using the `sinfo` command.

``` {.bash language="bash"}
# Example listing queues
sinfo -p partition_name --Format="%Q"
```

## 3.6 Job Submission to a Specific Queue 

Specify a queue when submitting a job using the `â€“qos` flag.

``` {.bash language="bash"}
# Example job submission to a specific queue
sbatch --partition=partition_name --qos=queue_name my_job.sh
```

Congratulations! You've learned about SLURM partitions and queues. In
the next tutorial, we'll explore job dependencies and advanced
submission options.
